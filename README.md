# modbus2mqtt.config

Modbus2mqtt provides an easy way for smart home systems to interact with all kinds of modbus devices.

It uses "specifications" to describe the mapping from modbus data to mqtt data.
An end user can select the specification and will then get the modbus data via mqtt into the smart home system.

A more experienced user can create own specifications.

This repository will contain specifications published by experienced users.
